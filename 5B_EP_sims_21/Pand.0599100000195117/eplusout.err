   ** Warning ** BuildingSurface:Detailed="G_5", Sun Exposure="SUNEXPOSED".
   **   ~~~   ** ..This surface is not exposed to External Environment.  Sun exposure has no effect.
   ** Severe  ** For zone: ZONE_0599100000195117 it is not possible to calculate the volume from the surrounding surfaces so either provide the volume value or define all the surfaces to fully enclose the zone.
   ** Warning ** Indicated Zone Volume <= 0.0 for Zone=ZONE_0599100000195117
   **   ~~~   ** The calculated Zone Volume was=0.00
   **   ~~~   ** The simulation will continue with the Zone Volume set to 10.0 m3. 
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings;
